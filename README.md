# myEditor.js
a cross-platform, lightweight Free pure javascript WYSIWYG editor.
It was originally a part of my other personal project which I decided to share this.
The editor works in two modes : simple mode and paper mode. In the paper mode you can type anywhere like a paper just by double clicking or double tapping(in touch devices)  in that area.

# Sample 
[you can try the editor here](https://rawgit.com/a-pedram/myEditor.js/master/sample.html)

# Installation 
You only need to copy js and css to your project and then link your page  to  js/myEditor.js , js/ui.js and css/myEditor.css !  Take a look at the [sampleâ€™ source here](https://github.com/a-pedram/myEditor.js/blob/master/sample.html)
